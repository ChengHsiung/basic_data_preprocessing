**From the article**

*Data preprocessing is the first (and arguably most important) step toward building a working machine learning model. It’s critical!*

*If your data hasn’t been cleaned and preprocessed, your model does not work.*

**It’s that simple.**

*Data preprocessing is generally thought of as the boring part. But it’s the difference between being prepared and being completely unprepared. It’s the difference between looking like a pro and looking pretty foolish.*

*It’s kind of like getting ready for a vacation. You might not like the preparation part, but tightening down the details in advance can save you from one nightmare of a trip.*

*You just have to do it or you can’t start having fun.*
